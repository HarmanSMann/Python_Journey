Right now: May 27th 2022 -> just following the tutorial

The Plan: Instead of the camera facing the wall, I plan to make it a top down view for to track my whole hand
Changes: I want it to act as much as a mouse as it can

What I will need to figure out:
1 - how will I track a click motion verses a moving motion
2 - track finger or some other ppoint for my hand
