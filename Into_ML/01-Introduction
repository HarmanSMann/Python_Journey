What is Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is a way for computers to learn patterns fromdata and mamke decisions without being explicityly programmed

Instead f running through manual rules (like using if statements or conditions), we teac the computer by providing it information about some interaction and giving it a yes or no, reinforcement learning for what to do and what not to do.

Types of ML
    Supervided Learning
        You provide labeled data (inputs and correct outputs)
        Model learns to predict labels from features
        Examples:
            Predict house prices (Regression)
            Detect spam emails (Classification)

    Upsupervised Learning
        You provide unlabeled data
        Model finds hidden patterns or structures
        Examples:
            Group customers into segments (Clustering)
            Reduce data dimensions (PCA)

    Reinforcement Learning
        Model learns from rewards and punishments
        Often used in gaming, robotics
        Examples:
            Self-learning chess engines
            Training a robot to walk

Term	                Meaning
Feature	                A variable used as input (e.g., age, weight)
Label/Target	        What you're predicting (e.g., price, yes/no)
Model	                A function that maps input to output
Training	            Teaching the model using data
Testing	                Measuring how well the model performs
Overfitting	            Model memorizes instead of generalizing
Underfitting	        Model is too simple to learn patterns
